# Photo Slider

### React, TypeScript, Vercel

I built and deployed a photo slider site with animation using TypeScript, React, and Sass. The site is responsive and can be viewed on any device.

<ul>
  <li>Used TypeScript to add type safety and other features to my JavaScript code.</li>
  <li>Used React to build a responsive and user-friendly photo slider.</li>
  <li>Deployed my photo slider site to Vercel, a cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy web applications.</li>
  <li>Used Sass to create a custom stylesheet for my photo slider site.</li>
</ul>
